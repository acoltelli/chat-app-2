## Stack
This project is built using Flask and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), a javascript library which enables realtime communication between web clients and servers using the [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol. Message history is currently stored locally but migration to a database is trivial with Flask.
